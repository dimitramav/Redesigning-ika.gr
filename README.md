# Redesigning-ika.gr

In this project we redesign a helenic social security website (ika.gr). Our implementation divides the users in four categories
(insured,retired,employees and disability). Two of them (insured,retired) are chosen to be fully developed. A user that belongs 
in one of these categories, is allowed to make requests, fill and view forms etc. He/she also has his/her own profile with 
personal information, history and feedback of the user's actions during the navigation.
